🛒 Compare – UK Grocery Price Comparison Prototype

Compare is a portfolio project designed to explore and prototype an idea:
A smarter, UK-focused grocery shopping app that finds the cheapest supermarket for your full basket.

⸻

💡 Project Overview

The idea behind Compare is simple but powerful:
	•	You pick your recipes (from a built-in library or imported manually)
	•	The app builds your full shopping list
	•	It then compares prices across major UK supermarkets (Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Aldi, Morrisons)
	•	You get a clear breakdown of which store is cheapest overall — or by item
	•	You can choose “Single Store Mode” or a smart split to balance savings and convenience

⸻

🎯 Purpose

This is a personal portfolio project, built to:
	•	Expand my front-end development skills
	•	Learn how to integrate external data sources and APIs
	•	Explore algorithmic price comparison logic
	•	Build a working prototype I can share publicly
	•	Demonstrate my design and UX thinking as a freelance developer

This project is not connected to live supermarket APIs (yet) — pricing is placeholder/simulated. The focus is on UI/UX, logic structure, and usability.
