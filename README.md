💡 Project Overview

The concept is simple but powerful:
	•	🧾 Choose your recipes (from a built-in library or add your own)
	•	🛍️ The app builds your shopping list automatically
	•	🛒 It compares prices across major UK supermarkets:
	•	Tesco
	•	Asda
	•	Sainsbury’s
	•	Aldi
	•	Morrisons
	•	📊 You get a clear breakdown of which store is cheapest:
	•	Overall
	•	Per item
	•	🧠 Choose between:
	•	Single Store Mode for convenience
	•	Smart Split for maximum savings

🎯 Project Purpose

This app was built as a personal freelance portfolio project to:
	•	Expand and refine front-end development skills
	•	Learn integration patterns with external data sources and APIs
	•	Explore logic for smart, algorithm-driven price comparison
	•	Build a real, usable prototype to share publicly
	•	Demonstrate design systems, UI/UX thinking, and logic flow

⚠️ This is not connected to live APIs (yet). Prices and availability are currently simulated using local mock data. Focus is on user experience, UI, and core logic.
